# Buoywatch App Landing Page

Buoywatch is an independent iOS/watchOS app which allows you to get real-time buoy waves data and get aware when the surf is good at a glance.
Too often swell arrives later than predicted, by checking the buoy data you can determine if the swell has arrived. If not, you can go back to bed =)
